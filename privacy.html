  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Clippy ("App") converts your local videos, generates subtitles, and if you connect TikTok, uploads clips to your TikTok account using the official API.</p>
  <h2>Data We Process</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Local video/audio files you select (processed on your device).</li>
    <li>Generated subtitle files (stored locally unless you delete them).</li>
    <li>TikTok OAuth tokens (stored only on your device to authenticate uploads).</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What We Don’t Collect</h2>
  <p>No analytics, advertising identifiers, or server side storage by the creator. All data remains local unless you choose to upload to TikTok.</p>
  <h2>Sharing</h2>
  <p>When you choose to upload, the App sends your selected video to TikTok via their API after you grant permission.</p>
  <h2>Retention & Deletion</h2>
  <p>Tokens are stored locally and can be removed by disconnecting in the App or deleting the token file. Media and subtitles remain on your device until you delete them.</p>
  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
